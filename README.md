# 35-task-manager
## Task 1: Full-Stack Development Challenge (6-8 minutes)
Scenario:
You are tasked with building a simple task manager application. The application will allow users to add, view, and delete tasks. It will consist of two parts:

Front-end: A simple UI where users can interact with tasks.
Back-end: A REST API that handles CRUD operations for tasks.

Requirements:
Create a simple React.js interface to manage tasks (Add, View, Delete).
Build a Node.js (Express) back-end to manage these tasks. You can use an in-memory store or a simple JSON file to save tasks (optional: use MySQL for persistent storage if you have time).
